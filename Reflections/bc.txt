BINOMIAL CO-EFFICIENT

1D implementation is used when only final result is desired. Time complexity is n. In terms of space, this is the efficient one.
2D implementation is useful when all the computation steps are required. Time complexity is (n*k).  
Recursion is used for smaller values. Not efficient in terms of memory. 
Comparing 2D and recursion, 2D is recommended as it stores the already computed values by dynamic programming whereas entire computation takes place in recursion.
